Mesoscale eddies, including coherent vortices, shape vertical structure, moderate pathways to dissipation, and control tracer transport and mixing throughout the ocean. As modern climate models approach eddy-permitting resolutions, subgrid parameterizations face new challenges in representing mixing and transport associated with mesoscale eddies. One such challenge lies in formulating backscatter parameterizations, which reinject unresolved eddy kinetic energy (EKE) into the resolved flow, to mimic the vertical and horizontal energy fluxes driven by eddies. This work investigates the environmental and dynamical factors that govern EKE vertical structure. Our general approach is to: (1) characterize eddy vertical structure globally using both observations and model output, and (2) to determine factors controlling its spatio-temporal variability. Using full depth observations of velocity at select mooring locations and the CM2.6 model suite, we develop and apply an unsupervised clustering model to identify spatial patterns in eddy vertical structure. These patterns reveal vertical structure regimes, some of which relate to dynamical mode expectations. Across much of the globe, mesoscale EKE is significant in the deep ocean. We find both bottom roughness and the eddy scale to Rhines scale separation to be important factors determining the vertical structure regime. Through characterizing vertical structure regimes and their governing characteristics, we can physically inform backscatter parameterizations by incorporating vertical structure knowledge into the parameterized energy fluxes.

The top left panel is the alongshore velocity, marked by a bottom-intensified (blue) and surface-intensified (red) jet. The lower jet is formed as the dense water moves off the shelf and is deflected to the right by the Coriolis force; the upper jet is due to surface return flow that is also deflected to the right. The bottom-intensified jet is weaker due to the presence of bottom drag. The lower left plot shows the passive tracer concentration, used to track the dense shelf water as it descends down the slope through the bottom boundary and then undergoes off-slope mixing by symmetric instability. The right panels show the offshore and vertical velocities, where the signature along-front diagonal motions of the symmetric instability are evident.</i>
