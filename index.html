Hello!
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://caos.cims.nyu.edu">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>
at New York University specializing in physical oceanography, ocean modelling, and geophysical fluid dynamics.
I am a member of the <a href= "https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io">Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team</a> (CPT).
My research within the CPT aims to understand the vertical structure of mesoscale eddies in the ocean, and how to parameterize eddy influences in modern ocean models. 
Broadly, I am interested in ocean turbulence and its influences on the large-scale ocean state and climate.<br>
<br>

Prior to joining the CPT, I was a graduate student in the <a href="https://aos.princeton.edu/"> Princeton Atmospheric and Oceanic Sciences Program</a> and conducted research within the <a href="https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/"> NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory</a>. 
My graduate research focused on the dense water formation processes within the vast continental shelf regions of the Arctic Ocean. 
I studied the role of mesoscale and submesoscale turbulence in shaping how dense water flows undergo mixing and modify the thermohaline structure of the Arctic. 
Through performing high-resolution processes studies using the GFDL-MOM6 and the MITgcm, I identified submesoscale symmetric instability to be a dominant mechanism guiding mixing in dense Arctic flows. 
Based on the physical insights that I obtained from process studies, I developed a parameterization for deep-ocean symmetric instability that represents mixing in the bottom boundary layer fronts that terrain-following flows give rise to. 
I implemented and tested this parameterization with the GFDL-MOM6, and found that the scheme successfully captures water mass modification when the instabilities are not resolved by the model grid.
In the final component of my PhD research, I turned to a global general circulation model (the GFDL-OM4) and considered the climatically-relevant question of how dense water formation and thermohaline structure of the Arctic will change as the region undergoes some of the most drastic warming on Earth. <br>

<br>
Both my graduate and postdoctoral research have centered on the intersection of high-resolution idealized modeling to understand the physics governing a given system, applying this understanding to improving coarser-resolution global ocean models, and using  global ocean models to study the influences of small-scale phenomena on the global oceanic circulation. <br>
<br>
Outside of research, I love rock climbing, hiking in the mountains, playing music, volunteering at animal shelters, and being with my two cats.
