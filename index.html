Hello!
I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a href="https://caos.cims.nyu.edu">Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>
at New York University specializing in physical oceanography, ocean modelling, and geophysical fluid dynamics.
I am also a member of the <a href= "https://ocean-eddy-cpt.github.io">Ocean Transport and Eddy Energy Climate Process Team</a> (CPT).
Mesoscale eddies modulate the stratification, mixing and dissipation pathways, and tracer transport of oceanic flows over a wide range of spatiotemporal scales. The parameterization of buoyancy and energy fluxes associated with mesoscale eddies presents an evolving challenge for ocean modelers, particularly as modern climate models approach eddy-permitting resolutions.
My research within the CPT aims to understand the vertical structure of eddy energy in the ocean, and how to parameterize eddy influences in modern ocean models.
